# Set up unmanaged (BYOD) devices

Every device is a possible attack avenue into your network and must be monitored and managed properly, even those devices that are personally owned but used for work. In this critical mission, you set up protection for all the bring-your-own devices (BYODs), which are those that are most risky to your organization due to being unmanaged. It's important to help everyone get their devices protected as soon as possible.

Your objectives are as follows:

- [Get everyone to set up MFA](m365bp-multifactor-authentication.md).
- [Get Office apps installed on devices](m365bp-install-office-apps.md).
- [Protected unmanaged Windows and Mac devices](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md).

Once you've accomplished these objectives, proceed with your [next mission](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md).
