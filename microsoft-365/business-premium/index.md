# Microsoft 365 Business Premium &mdash; cybersecurity for small business

Let us begin by saying that you made a wise choice in adopting Microsoft 365 Business Premium and its world class productivity tools. Designed with cybersecurity in mind, Microsoft 365 Business Premium safeguard's your data, devices and information. You are your organization's first and best defense against hackers and cyberattackers, including random individuals, organized crime, or highly-sophisticated nation states.

The task before you is this—let Microsoft 365 Business Premium help secure your organization’s future! Approach this task by taking on the following missions which will help you fortify your environment, train your team, and safeguard managed devices. The missions are organized as follows:

- **[Fortify your environment](m365bp-setup-overview.md)** (tasks your admin does); 
- **[Train your team](m365bp-devices-overview.md)** (tasks that all staff members do); and 
- **[Safeguard managed devices](m365bp-protect-devices.md)** (tasks your admin or security team does).

Completing all the missions is the most effective way to thwart hackers, protect against ransomware, and help ensure your organization’s future is safeguarded with the best cybersecurity defenses. Let's get started.

## Fortify your environment

In these first missions, you sign in and set up your initial walls of defense, starting with account access protections.

## Train your team

We've included a set of missions here with some objectives that need to be completed by your team (all employees). You have to make sure the team's devices are protected, and that your team is trained to use email and file sharing safely, and able to recognize and report threats.

1. [**Set up BYOD devices**](m365bp-protect-pcs-macs.md). In this mission, you set up all the unmanaged (BYOD) devices so they are safely part of the ecosystem.

2. [**Protect email**](m365bp-protect-email-overview.md). Take the necessary steps to protect the email systems from attack.

3. [**Collaborate and share securely**](m365bp-collaborate-share-securely.md). The objectives of this mission require you to set up secure file sharing for all members of the organization.

- [**Set up and secure managed devices**](m365bp-protect-devices.md). Take the steps to secure those devices so they are monitored and protected by the organization.
